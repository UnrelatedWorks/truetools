# truetools
a set of scripts and tools to improve TrueNas

We will try to make them as beginner friendly as possible. We want to make it as easy as possible for everyone to set up their TrueNas and to improve it. 
Remember we where all beginners once and had no idea how to manualy configure iP Tables.

<h2>feel free to send pull requests for your own scripts. 
Then we can create a single repo as a one stop shop</h2>

Thank you
